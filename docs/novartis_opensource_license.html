<h2>
  The Initial Developer and Contributor Grants.</h2>
<p>
  Novartis and each Contributor hereby grant You a world-wide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive license,  to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
  sublicense and distribute the Source Code (or portions thereof), in any form
  including Software, with or without Modifications, or as part of a Larger
  Work; and where applicable to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform,
  sublicense and distribute the Modifications created by such Contributor (or
  portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other Modifications.</p>
<p>
  You, in quality of a Contributor, hereby grants Novartis a world-wide,
  royalty-free, non-exclusive license, to use, reproduce, modify, display,
  perform, sublicense and distribute any Contributor Version or Modifications
  created by You (or portions thereof) either on an unmodified basis, with other
  Modifications.</p>

<h2>
  License Governance</h2>

<p>
  <strong>Application of License:</strong> The Modifications which You create or
  to which You contribute, e.g. in quality of a Contributor, are governed by
  the terms of this License. The Source Code version of Covered Code,
  Contributor Version created by You or any Modification thereof, may be
  distributed only under the terms of this License, and You shall include a
  copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You
  shall not offer or impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters
  or restricts the applicable version of this License or the recipients'
  rights hereunder.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Availability of Source Code:</strong>
  Any Contributor Version or  Modification which You
  create or to which You contribute shall be made available in Source Code form
  under the terms of this License either on the same media as an Executable
  version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom
  you made an Executable version available. Description of Modifications: You
  must  cause all Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a Source Code
  Notice  documenting the changes You made to create that Covered Code and the
  date of any  change. You must include a prominent statement that the
  Modification is derived,  directly or indirectly, from Source Code provided by
  the Initial Developer and  including the name of the Initial Developer in (a)
  the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
  documentation in which You  describe the origin or ownership of the Covered
  Code. You are obliged to  disclose to Novartis all changes and improvements
  you have introduced.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Required Notices:</strong> You must duplicate the Source Code Notice
  in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any documentation for
  the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights relating to Covered
  Code. If You created one or more Modification(s), You may add your name as a
  Contributor to the Source Code Notice. If it is not possible to put such
  notice in a particular Source Code file due to its structure, then you must
  include such notice in a location (such as a relevant directory file) where
  a user would be likely to look for such a notice. You may choose to offer,
  and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may do
  so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
  any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty,
  support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor for
  any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
  result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Distribution of Executable Versions:</strong> If You distribute the
  Executable version under a different license You must make it absolutely clear
  that any terms which differ from this License are offered by You alone, not by
  the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
  Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the
  Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You
  offer.</p>

<p>
  <strong>Larger Works:</strong> You may create a Larger Work by combining
  Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this License and
  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
  sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Covered Code.</p>
